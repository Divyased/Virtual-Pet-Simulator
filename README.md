Project Description:

Virtual pet simulator is a basic console application in C# developed to take care of a pet. The detailed features of this project includes

1. Creating and naming pet of our preference (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit).
 
2. Implementing some pet care actions such as feeding the pet, playing with the pet, and letting the pet rest.

   When we feed the pet, pet's hunger decreases and health increases slightly.

   When we play with the pet, it's happiness and hunger also increases.

   And finally, when we put them to rest, health improves and happiness slightly decreases.

3. And also there is a feature to check the status of the pet on a scale of 1 to 10 according to the current condition of the pet.

   Each action will modify the status of the pet accordingly and also displays the message showing each action's effect.
